# MNIST-Image-Compression-with-Autoencoder
This project uses a convolutional autoencoder to compress and reconstruct 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits (0-9) from the MNIST dataset. It reduces image size while preserving key features and reconstructs them with minimal loss. Built with Python, TensorFlow, and Keras, it demonstrates efficient image compression techniques
